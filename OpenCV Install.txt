The below steps for using Android OpenCV sdk in Android Studio. This is a simplified version of this(1) SO answer.

Download latest OpenCV sdk for Android from OpenCV.org and decompress the zip file.
Import OpenCV to Android Studio, From File -> New -> Import Module, choose sdk/java folder in the unzipped opencv archive.
Update build.gradle under imported OpenCV module to update 4 fields to match your project build.gradle a) compileSdkVersion b) buildToolsVersion c) minSdkVersion and d) targetSdkVersion.
Add module dependency by Application -> Module Settings, and select the Dependencies tab. Click + icon at bottom, choose Module Dependency and select the imported OpenCV module.
For Android Studio v1.2.2, to access to Module Settings : in the project view, right-click the dependent module -> Open Module Settings
Copy libs folder under sdk/native to Android Studio under app/src/main.
In Android Studio, rename the copied libs directory to jniLibs and we are done.
Step (6) is since Android studio expects native libs in app/src/main/jniLibs instead of older libs folder. For those new to Android OpenCV, don't miss below steps

include static{ System.loadLibrary("opencv_java"); } (Note: for OpenCV version 3 at this step you should instead load the library opencv_java3.)
For step(5), if you ignore any platform libs like x86, make sure your device/emulator is not on that platform.
